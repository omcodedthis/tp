# ItemTasker

A CLI-based Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) Ticketing System. A localized command-line tool designed to handle inventory specific actions required for individual item SKUs such as damage checks, expiry reviews & quality control. Unlike standard commercial inventory software that tracks quantity, ItemTracker tracks accountability & actions, allowing managers to attach specific tasks with priorities to individual SKUs.

# User Guide

## Introduction

ItemTasker is a desktop Command Line Interface
(CLI) application designed for warehouse inventory management.
It lets warehouse operators efficiently track Stock Keeping 
Units (SKUs) and their associated maintenance
or operational tasks — all from the keyboard, with no GUI overhead.
Built with Java 17, ItemTasker follows a clean layered 
architecture (UI → Logic → Model → Storage) and models a 3×3 warehouse grid. 
Each SKU maps to a physical grid location (A1–C3) and carries its own task list,
where every task can be assigned a due date, a priority level 
(HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW), and a description.
The application persists all state to JSON automatically on exit
and reloads it seamlessly on the next launch.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed on your computer.

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](http://link.to/itemtasker).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for ItemTasker.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the following command to run the application:
```
   java -jar itemtasker.jar
```
If the setup is correct, you should see the welcome message appear in a few seconds.

5. Type a command and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing Enter will display all available commands. Some example commands you can try:
    * `listtasks` : Lists all tasks across all SKUs.
    * `addsku n/PALLET-A l/B2` : Adds a new SKU named `PALLET-A` at warehouse location `B2`.
    * `addskutask n/PALLET-A d/2026-06-15 p/HIGH t/Check stock` : Adds a high-priority task to `PALLET-A` due on 15 June 2026.
    * `marktask n/PALLET-A i/1` : Marks the 1st task of `PALLET-A` as completed.
    * `deletesku n/PALLET-A` : Deletes `PALLET-A` and all its associated tasks.
    * `viewmap` : Displays the 3×3 warehouse grid with SKU locations.
    * `bye` : Exits the application.

6. Refer to the Features section below for the full details of each command.

### Adding a task: `addskutask`
Adds a new task to an existing SKU.

Deletes a specific task from a SKU's task list.

Format: `deletetask n/SKU_ID i/TASK_INDEX`

* `TASK_INDEX` refers to the task's position in the SKU's task list (starting from 1).
* This action is irreversible.

Example of usage:

`deletetask n/PALLET-A i/2`

---

### Marking a task: `marktask`
Marks a specific task as completed.

Format: `marktask n/SKU_ID i/TASK_INDEX`

* `TASK_INDEX` refers to the task's position in the SKU's task list (starting from 1).
* If the task is already marked as done, the application will notify you.

Example of usage:

`marktask n/PALLET-A i/1`

---

### Unmarking a task: `unmarktask`
Marks a previously completed task as not done.

Format: `unmarktask n/SKU_ID i/TASK_INDEX`

* `TASK_INDEX` refers to the task's position in the SKU's task list (starting from 1).
* If the task is already unmarked, the application will notify you.

---

### Sorting tasks: `sorttasks`
Sorts a SKU's task list by a specified field.

* Using `p/` filters tasks by priority level (`HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, or `LOW`).
* Using `l/` lists all tasks sorted by distance from the specified grid location.
* Using no filter lists all tasks across all SKUs.

Example of usage:

`listtasks`

`listtasks n/PALLET-A`

`listtasks p/HIGH`

### Finding tasks: `find`
Searches for tasks matching one or more criteria.

## FAQ
**Q**: How do I transfer my warehouse data to another computer?  
**A**: Install the application on the other computer and run it once to generate the default folders. Then, simply overwrite the `Data/storage.json` file it creates with the `storage.json` file from your previous computer.

**Q**: Do I need to manually save my tasks before closing the application?  
**A**: No. ItemTasker automatically saves your entire inventory and task list to the hard disk whenever you close the application using the `bye` or `exit` commands. Just ensure you exit the app properly instead of force-closing the terminal!

**Q**: Can I use my own custom location names like "Loading-Dock" or "Aisle-12"?  
**A**: Currently, ItemTasker strictly uses a standardized 3x3 grid system (A1 through C3) to ensure spatial sorting and distance calculations work instantly. You must assign SKUs to one of the 9 predefined sectors.

**Q**: How does the `listtasks l/LOCATION` command calculate distance?  
**A**: It calculates the "Manhattan Distance" across the warehouse grid. It measures the physical grid steps required to move from your specified location to the SKU's location, bringing the closest tasks to the top of your list so you can clear them efficiently.

**Q**: What happens if I manually edit the `storage.json` file and make a mistake?  
**A**: If the JSON format becomes invalid, outdated, or corrupted due to manual edits, ItemTasker will print a warning on startup and begin with an empty warehouse to prevent system crashes. It is highly recommended to make a copy of your `storage.json` file before doing any manual tweaking.

**Q**: Can I edit multiple fields of a task at once?  
**A**: Yes. The `edittask` command accepts any combination of `d/` (due date), `p/` (priority), and `t/` (description) flags simultaneously. Only the fields you specify will be updated. All other fields are preserved.

**Q**: What is the difference between `viewmap` and `status`?  
**A**: `viewmap` is a visual tool that shows the physical distribution of tasks across the A1-C3 grid. `status` is an analytical tool that provides a breakdown of task completion percentages and identifies which SKUs require immediate attention.
